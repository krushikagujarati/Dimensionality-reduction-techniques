# Dimensionality-reduction-techniques

### Introduction
This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks focused on advanced data analysis techniques. These notebooks serve as practical guides for implementing dimensionality reduction, leveraging UMAP algorithms, and utilizing Databricks for comprehensive data analysis.

### File Descriptions

**1. Dimensionality Reduction.ipynb**

This notebook provides an in-depth exploration of dimensionality reduction techniques. It includes theory, practical examples, and implementation in Python. Key topics may include PCA, t-SNE, and other relevant methods.

**2. UMAP.ipynb**

UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel dimensionality reduction technique. This notebook covers the UMAP algorithm, its advantages over traditional methods, and its implementation on sample datasets.

**3. Databricks.ipynb**

Focused on Databricks, this notebook demonstrates how to leverage cloud-based big data analytics. It includes examples of data processing, ETL operations, and collaborative features of Databricks.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, umap-learn (for UMAP notebook)
* Access to Databricks (for the Databricks notebook)

### Setup and Installation
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn umap-learn
```
For the Databricks notebook, ensure you have access to a Databricks account and the necessary configurations are set up.

### Usage
To use these notebooks, clone the repository and launch Jupyter Notebook in your environment. You can then open each notebook and run the cells sequentially to understand the concepts and code.
